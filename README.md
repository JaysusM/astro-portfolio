# Astro Portfolio Project

This project was my first dive into **Astro**! I wanted to give it a try, and what better excuse than creating a simple portfolio for my girlfriend?

## Purpose

The main goal was to explore **Astro** and get a feel for how it works. Along the way, I built a basic portfolio site for her, which showcases her info in a minimal and clean design. Always keeping the focus on responsiveness and accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro**: The core framework for the site.
- **Plain CSS**: No frameworks, just simple styling.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaysusM/astro-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the dev server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The site will be up at `http://localhost:4321`.

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

It was a fun project, and I enjoyed working with Astro!
